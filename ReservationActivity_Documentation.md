# Documentation for ReservationActivity.java

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `ReservationActivity.java` file in the Restaurant application.

### Overall Purpose

The `ReservationActivity.java` file is the Java counterpart to the `activity_reservation.xml` layout file. Its primary job is to control the logic and user interaction for the "Make a Reservation" screen. Its main responsibilities are to display the layout and provide a way for the user to navigate back to the previous screen.

### Detailed Code Breakdown

#### Class Definition

```java
public class ReservationActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
```

*   `public class ReservationActivity`: This declares a new public class named `ReservationActivity`. "Public" means it can be accessed by other classes in your application, like `SingUpActivity`.
*   `extends AppCompatActivity`: This is a key part of Android development. `ReservationActivity` is a "subclass" of `AppCompatActivity`. This means it inherits all the standard behaviors of an Android screen (an "Activity"), including handling user input, managing the screen's lifecycle, and displaying a user interface. `AppCompatActivity` specifically ensures that your activity has a consistent look and feel across different versions of Android.

#### `onCreate()` Method

This method is the entry point for your activity. It's called by the Android system when the `ReservationActivity` is first created and displayed on the screen.

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_reservation);

    if (getSupportActionBar() != null) {
        getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
    }
}
```

*   **`Bundle savedInstanceState`**: This parameter is used to save and restore the state of your activity. For example, if the user rotates their phone, the activity is destroyed and recreated. The `savedInstanceState` bundle would allow you to restore any information they've already entered (like the name or number of guests) so it's not lost. This functionality is not currently used in this file.
*   **`super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)`**: This line calls the `onCreate` method of the parent class (`AppCompatActivity`). It's crucial to always call the superclass method first to ensure all the basic setup for the activity is done correctly.
*   **`setContentView(R.layout.activity_reservation)`**: This is the line that connects your Java code to your XML layout.
    *   `R` is a special class automatically generated by Android that contains IDs for all the resources in your project.
    *   `R.layout.activity_reservation` is the ID for the layout file located at `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_reservation.xml`.
    *   This line tells the activity to display the UI elements (the `EditText` fields, `Button`, etc.) defined in that XML file.
*   **`if (getSupportActionBar() != null)`**: This checks if an "Action Bar" (the bar at the top of the screen) is present.
*   **`getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true)`**: If the Action Bar exists, this line enables the "Up" button, which appears as a back arrow (`<--`) next to your app's title. This provides a standard way for users to navigate back from the current screen.

#### `onOptionsItemSelected()` Method

This method is called whenever an item in the options menu (including the Action Bar) is tapped.

```java
@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    if (item.getItemId() == android.R.id.home) {
        finish();
        return true;
    }
    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
}
```

*   **`MenuItem item`**: This parameter represents the menu item that the user tapped.
*   **`if (item.getItemId() == android.R.id.home)`**: This `if` statement checks the ID of the tapped item.
    *   `android.R.id.home` is the predefined Android system ID for the "Home" or "Up" button in the Action Bar (the back arrow enabled in `onCreate`).
*   **`finish()`**: If the user tapped the "Up" button, this method is called. `finish()` destroys the current activity (`ReservationActivity`) and removes it from the screen, revealing the previous activity (e.g., `SingUpActivity`).
*   **`return true;`**: This tells the Android system that you have successfully handled the tap event.
*   **`return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item)`**: If the tapped item was *not* the "Up" button, this line passes the event to the parent class (`AppCompatActivity`) to handle it. This ensures that any default menu behavior still works correctly.

### How It Interacts with Other Components

1.  **Launched from another Activity (e.g., `SingUpActivity`)**: The `ReservationActivity` is typically started from another activity. For instance, when a user taps the "Make a Reservation" button on the sign-up screen, the `SingUpActivity.java` file creates an `Intent` and calls `startActivity(intent)` to create and display this `ReservationActivity`.

2.  **Displays `activity_reservation.xml`**: The `setContentView()` call in `onCreate` inflates the layout from the corresponding XML file, making the user interface visible.

3.  **Returns to the Previous Activity**: When the user taps the back arrow in the Action Bar, the `onOptionsItemSelected` method calls `finish()`, which closes the `ReservationActivity` and returns the user to the screen they came from.
